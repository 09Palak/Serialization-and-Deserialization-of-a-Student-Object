THIS IS CODE FOR:
Part b: Serialization and Deserialization of a Student Object
Objective:
To implement Java serialization to save a Student object to a file and later retrieve it through deserialization.

Explanation:
Serialization helps persist object state and is useful for saving objects in files or transmitting over a network. This task includes:

Creating a Student class with fields like studentID, name, and grade.

Making the class implement the Serializable interface.

Writing a program to:

Serialize the Student object using ObjectOutputStream.
Save it to a file.
Deserialize it using ObjectInputStream to reconstruct the object.
Print the studentâ€™s data to confirm successful deserialization.
